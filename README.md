# Dreamhigh-Blog-Reader-app


This application uses Google Blogger API.

I have intensionally added my own blog -- "Dream High" in this app.
You can clone the project and change the url string to whatever blog you want to appear on the app. for that you would of course need your own API key. get it from here -- 
https://developers.google.com/blogger/

Google Blogger API is extremely easy to use and you may for sure use this for building your own Blog Reader App.
